    Mirastell Combat:<br>3 Years of Iteration
</h1>
<div class="textContainer">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Over the course of 3 years I developed the simple turn-based combat Mirastell began with into a unique system with
        original, purposeful mechanics and progression systems that dramatically improved the player experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through this process I learned the importance of keeping systems simple and understandable, as well as how to design
        iteratively. The current version of Mirastell’s combat is unique, engaging, and has a low bar for entry while still
        providing a massive skill ceiling.
        <br>
        <br>
        Generally, I like to keep my designs as “lean” as possible. Any changes I make to game systems are always built
        specifically to solve a problem, or fulfill a design goal. The efficacy of this approach is apparent in the success
        we’ve had with the combat system in Mirastell.

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>
        The first Mirastell prototypes from 2017 featured a simple turn based combat system. Players could choose to attack,
        heal themselves, attempt to run away, or use an item which could cure negative status effects. After defeating an enemy
        the player would gain XP and eventually level up, increasing their maximum health.
        <br>
        <br>
        This first iteration of combat turned out to be pretty bad. There was really no skill involved, the player basically
        just had to repeatedly click “attack” and the game played itself. Combat served no purpose except blocking the player
        from entering zones which they weren’t leveled enough for.
        <br>
        <br>
        The core problem was that combat didn’t require any real skill or strategy. I quickly made some changes, and within a
        few months I had the next iteration working. Now, all attacks now required a skill shot, meaning you had to time your
        attacks correctly with enemies, and could avoid the enemies' attacks. These changes were able to add a skillful element
        to combat, which greatly improved it.

        <br>
        To keep combat interesting I built some tools to allow for multiple enemy types, and groups of enemies, which allowed me
        to vary difficulty in combat more. These elements proved to be effective, and all still exist in the game today.

        <br>
        Moving on, I quickly identified the next problem I would need to solve: landing an attack was difficult, and missing
        your attack was extremely punishing. I tried tuning the values of the player’s attack to be a little more powerful
        (higher projectile velocity and damage) but that didn’t really solve the problem, especially for newer players who
        needed time to develop muscle memory, something I couldn’t compensate for with weapon stats.
        <br>
        <br>
        The solution wasn’t terribly complicated, although it would take some effort to implement, the player would just have to
        be able to shoot multiple times per turn. Instead of having the player’s attack instantly fire, I would put them into a
        new state where they could launch multiple projectiles. I built a quick prototype by just disabling the enemies turn,
        which worked well, so I got to work.

        <br>
        At the same time, I was working on progression systems for the game, and so while I was adding in the new player state I
        built support for different weapon types. This meant we could have weapons with different fire rates, damage amounts,
        projectile speeds, recoil intensities, and magazine sizes. In the background I also added functionality for
        weapon-specific scripts, which would later allow me to add special effects to weapons like tracking.
        <br>
        <br>
        Building support for multiple weapon types was an extremely important step in the development of the game. After seeing
        the results of this change, we continued to add new items, and built out an extensive quest loot system which forms a
        big part of the long-term gameplay loop.
