        The Volskaya Raid activity is the most complex Overwatch mod I've ever built. The gamemode is a PvE activity that resembles a raid boss encounter from a game like Destiny or WoW. The encounter I constructed features several mechanics designed that create tense and chaotic combat.

        To support this project I designed and implemented custom perks and abilities for every hero in the game which help to balance heros for a PvE environment, allow players to create more diverse team compositions, and fulfill player fantasies. I also created several advanced enemy AIs that include free-roam behaviors powered by a custom build node-based pathfinding system, as well as combat and search behaviors.
