    The Making of Mirastell

    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>
        When I started out on Mirastell in 2017, the plan was to quickly complete a portfolio piece before applying to college. While working on the game, I fell in love with design, and spent over 3 years assembling a team and developing the game into a fully fledged indie game, with a small community of fans.
        <br>
        <br>
        The development of the game allowed me to sharpen my design instincts and grow my skills. This experience, along with hundreds of hours devoted to learning about game design (the GDC vault truly is wonderful), has given me a great foundation to continue to develop my skills as a designer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now that I’m at the end of the development process, looking back at my work fills me with pride. I can say, without a doubt, that this game is the greatest thing I’ve ever done with my life. Nothing else can give the same feeling as watching a player’s face when they hit a twist in the story, finally unlock a new piece of gear, or solve a challenging puzzle.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m excited to keep pushing, and do something even greater next.

    <h2>The Context:</h2>
    <p>
        I started working on Mirastell in December, 2017. I was just 15 years old, but I had already been programming simple games for over 3 years. My grand life plan, at this time, was to graduate highschool 2 years later, get a bachelor’s in computer science, and go on to work at some tech company.
        <br>
        <br>
        Mirastell was meant to be nothing more than a project to put on my portfolio. These small ambitions would lead to something much larger, which altered the course of my life. Throughout the following months and years I fell in love with the game, and with the field of design. Since then I’ve worked hard to grow a small community of fans, and build something I’m incredibly proud of.

    <h2>Iterating the Game’s Structure:</h2>
    <p>
        The major design pillars I laid when I started seriously working on the game were:<br>
        1) Always maintain a sense of mystery and discovery for the player<br>
        2) The world should feel dangerous<br>
        3) Constantly provide a sense of progression<br>
        Over the years, the game’s core design went through several different major iterations, but throughout that time these design goals remained the same.
        <br>
        <br>
        The original vision for the game was a sort of open world Dungeon crawler, where the player would move through the ship, find new areas, fight through enemies to reach a boss, get some loot, and move on to the next area. Each area was pixel art that was hand-drawn by one of the artists working with me.
        <br>
        <br>
        This iteration of the game was fun, but the amount of content that we needed to build was staggering, especially from an art perspective. Hand drawing the level layouts resulted in some really fantastic art, but proved to be too taxing from a development perspective.
        <br>
        <br>
        To solve the content issues, we pivoted towards a procedurally generated rogue-like. During the core game loop the player would enter a randomly generated level (built from a tileset), defeat all the enemies, and then move down a floor, entering a new random level, and increasing the difficulty of the enemies. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This version’s core issue was the procedural generation system failing to create quality content. The random generation algorithms I built resulted in either chaos, or levels that all looked too similar. After working on it for several months, I decided to give up on this concept. 
        <br>
        <br>
        While building this iteration, we also created several small areas to support quest missions. These areas were pretty easy to build, and allowed us to create really high quality play spaces. In the spirit of following the fun, we leaned into this technique with the last iteration.
        <br>
        <br>
        The final version is structured more similarly to a traditional RPG, where you progress a main quest, which brings you from level to level, and you regularly find side quests. The main difference in Mirastell from most other RPGs is there is a focus on repeatable, “grindable” content. We have an activity called “dungeons” which are built to be replayable, and have some randomly generated elements, and selectable difficulty.

    <h2>The Final Product:</h2>
    <p>
        Today, when I sit down to play the game, it’s hard to believe this thing even exists. When I first started, a result like this looked impossible to me. There are so many different jobs that need to be done, so many skills to master along the way, so much time that needs to be invested. And yet, somehow, I’ve done it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I didn’t build an open world the size of a country, or a game with so much content it can be played for thousands of hours. I didn’t build the latest indie hit, I didn’t build the newest competitive esport.
        <br>
        <br>
        What I did build is a game, which I love to play. I think it’s unique, I think it’s deep, and most importantly I think it’s fun.
        <br>
        <br>
        I can’t wait to see what I will build next.
