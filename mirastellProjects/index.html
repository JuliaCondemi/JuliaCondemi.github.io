					Mirastell is a clear expression of my creative vision, which I have been working on for over 3 years. In recent months, I have collaborated with a few artists and a writer to finalize the game, and build post-launch content. Working with these developers has taught me a lot about how to express my vision for the game.
					<br>
					<br>
					Below, I've written up a list of features I worked on during development. Additionally, I have provided some longer write-ups about how the game has evolved over time, as well as some example code pulled from its lighting engine.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p class="white bold">Features:</p>
				<ul class="white">
					<li>
						Gameplay Design
						<ul>
							<li>
								Through years of iteration I evolved basic turn-based combat into a unique and engaging system which serves as a strong hook for players.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I created a progression system which focuses on creating player stories. This system includes several weapons, each with their own unique behavior and feel, as well as a variety of talents and equipment which players can unlock.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I developed a stealth system which adds tension and atmosphere to the game, and comes together with the combat system to create a compelling core game loop.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I created a challenging set of secret puzzles which involve code-breaking and pattern recognition. You can	find a recording of a streamer completing these puzzles <a
									href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/890673627?t=01h48m02s">here</a>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>
						System Design
						<ul>
							<li>
								I created a deep combat sandbox featuring multiple types of equipment, allowing players to customize their builds for specific play-styles.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I built several investment systems which use rewards to incentives players to engage with the game in new ways.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>
						Programming/Scripting
						<ul>
							<li>
								I built a 2D path-traced lighting engine using <a target="_blank" href="https://gpu.rocks">GPU.js</a> in order to create a more interesting visual style for our world.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I wrote a NodeJS multiplayer server and built a custom realtime multiplayer networking system that can connect players anywhere in the world, and allows players to host their own servers.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I created a custom level editing pipeline which automates the process of exporting levels from 3rd-party software, and importing them into the game.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>
						Narrative
						<ul>
							<li>
								I created a complex setting full of layered characters.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I wrote a unique, carefully paced narrative that is designed to accommodate players who love story, as well as players who prefer to just ignore it.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I placed lore pick-ups and environmental story elements throughout levels which work together with voice over and in-game cutscenes to maintain pacing.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<br>
					<li>
						Level Design
						<ul>
							<li>
								I designed a multitude of unique levels, most of which contain their own unique mechanics and combat challenges.
							</li>
							<br class="halfSize">
							<li>
								I used art assets, lights, and post-processing effects to create moody and evocative environment art that keeps players engaged during down time in the game.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
