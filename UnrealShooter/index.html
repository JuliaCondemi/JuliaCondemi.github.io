			<h1>
				Unreal Shooter (WIP)
			</h1>
			<p>
				This project is a work in progress first person shooter game.
				<br>
				<br>
				Typically, I like to make sure that projects are fairly polished before I add them to my portfolio, but I feel really great about how the weapons feel so far, so I wanted to add a preview of them ahead of the full project being completed.
				<br>
				<br>
				Weapons in this project have 22 different stats that I can use to create unique behavior and feel across different weapon types. These stats control things like recoil, aim speed, damage, and more.
