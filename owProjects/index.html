				<h1>Overwatch Mod Projects</h1>
				<p>
					Overwatch mods have been a great way to develop my design skills. Being able to build content on top of a really solid base of gameplay, sound and visuals has allowed me to create projects with scope and polish that I never could have achieved alone.
					<br>
					<br>
					Below, is a list of projects I have built in the workshop, along with some clips and a short description.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>The Volskaya Raid</h2>
				<br>
				<div class="videoWrapper">
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nezxlu91rXk" title="YouTube video player"
						frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
					"The Volskaya Raid" is my most ambitious project. It is a PvE activity inspired by the raids of "Destiny" or "WoW". The Raid has custom AI scripting, challenging mechanics, and new hero abilities for every hero.
					<br>
					<br>
					- There is no nav mesh or built-in pathfinding, so enemies use some clever tricks along with a custom node system to move around. Despite this they are still able to track players around corners, and search the area.
					<br>
					<br>
					- Heros all needed custom abilities to be able to deal with a PvE environment in a balanced and fun way. These abilities were inspired by statements I wrote for each hero, such as "I wade through enemies on the battlefield" for Reinhardt or "I'm an immovable object" for Orisa.
					<br>
					<br>
					- This game works with up to 4 players in co-op, and has been play tested several times with community members, who gave positive feedback.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>

				<h2>For Glory</h2>
				<br>
				<div class="videoWrapper">
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jCEoV2-QQx4" title="YouTube video player"
						frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
					"For Glory" is a project loosely inspired by "For Honor," a 3rd person fighting game by Ubisoft Montreal. This gamemode is first person, and features 3 different heros who all have a unique fighting style.
					<br>
					<br>
					- The AI featured in these videos was originally just built for testing, but it ended up being a pretty solid opponent and is still around in the playable version.
					<br>
					<br>
					- The gamemode is also playable as PvP, and works with as many players as you want.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>

				<h2>Other Custom Missions</h2>
				<br>
				<div class="videoWrapper">
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lMAs1LRWt0A" title="YouTube video player"
						frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
					Over my time with the Workshop, I have built several other short missions. These missions have custom AI, mission objectives, and hero balancing.
					<br>
					<br>
					- The clip featuring Winston is a stealth system that was never actually turned into a full mission due to some technical constraints which existed at the time. The stealth system allowed enemies to intellegently become aware of players using sounds they created.
