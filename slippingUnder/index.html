                        Slipping
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Your body is pulled into a tight ball. Every muscle is tensed and ready. Your eyes are pressed tightly together but a tear squeezes through and rolls slowly downward. You tuck your head into your chest.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Against your back you can feel the other leaning against you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They must be asleep. You are alone.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You lay, very quiet but very awake. You hope the other does not notice. That they do not feel the quick motion of your lungs or smell your fear. They can never know the truth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the first law of blind faith. You must never tell a soul.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You consider, why are you afraid?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        No, not why. There is no reason, no logic.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This feeling is too wild to be defined, to be held down. Your thoughts turn to the sky.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You fear the sunset.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You fear, the ending of the day. The coming of night. You fear sleep, silence, absence of thought. You fear the knock at the door. You fear the light in the tunnel.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You fear there is an end.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You stay at the table. You sit, you do not move or speak. You stare straight down and hope no one notices.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They cannot understand. They would judge you and tell you that you cannot not do anything to change it so why worry, as if you did not already know.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They would tell you that is just the way it works, and that you have to accept it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But you have tried to accept it. You have told yourself that everything is ok. You never really believe yourself.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the second law of blind faith. Always be afraid.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You want to stand and fight for your life but your heart is gone and in its place there is a void that saps your energy and pulls you down.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But that doesn't matter, because there is no winning this fight..
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All you can feel is the dread.. You tell yourself that your time will never come.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But, of course, it will.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's not as if you don't search for answers. Like you don't search every minute for an answer to your fear.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You despise your helplessness. You despise your weakness.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But no matter how much you rage or cry, no matter how much you curse your own name, you cannot alter the nature of your being.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the third law of blind faith. You can never change.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Why even bother?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Is it not easier to turn to a pipe? To suppress your mind so that there is no thought strong enough to reach you?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are no saviors, no hope in here.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You rocket down the highway. You are afraid if you slowed you might lose too much momentum so you press your foot down on the gas and shut your eyes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You stay at the bottom of the pit.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Your body is pulled tightly against itself. Your knees are drawn up and in towards your chest. Your eyes are open but you cannot see through the dark. Tears leak down your cheeks but you suppress the noise rising from your throat.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Against your back you can feel the other's back on your own.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They must be asleep. You are alone.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You lay, quietly brawling against your own mind. You hope the other does not notice. That they do not hear your heart or your screaming. They can never know the truth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the first law of blind faith. You must never tell a soul.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You wonder, why are you afraid?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        No, not why. There is no reason, no logic.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This feeling is too wild to be defined, to be spelled out. Your thoughts turn to the sky.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You fear the sunrise.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You fear the beginning of day. The coming dawn. You fear you cannot carry your burden again. You fear that there is no one to help, or that you are unworthy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You fear there is no end.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You stay in the corner. You sit, totally still, totally silent. Your second biggest fear is that someone will see you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They would never understand. They would judge you and tell you that your fear is illogical and invalid, as if you weren't already painfully aware of your insanity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They would tell you that this is a place to be happy and that you need to get over it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        No one else knows that there are no happy places. There is nowhere you can hide. Nowhere you can run.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the second law of blind faith. Always be afraid.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You want to stand and yell and run but your legs are bound tightly together and your lungs have collapsed under the pressure.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But that doesn't matter, because there is nowhere safe to run to anyway.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your blood is ice. You try to breathe. You hope it will pass.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But, of course, it won't.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's not as if you don't try to change. Like you don't hate yourself and every part of your soul and idea in your head.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You despise your helplessness. You despise your weakness.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But no matter how much you fight and struggle, no matter how much you wage war on your mind, you cannot alter the nature of your being.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the third law of blind faith. You can never change.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Why even bother?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Is it not easier to sink into the pillow? To swim so deep that there is no light strong enough to reach you?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are no saviors, no hope down here.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You rocket down the highway. You are afraid if you turned you might lose control so you take your hands off the wheel and let the road steer you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You stay at the bottom of the pit.
